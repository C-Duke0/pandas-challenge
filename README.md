In this analysis I used data provided by the school district to asses schools within the district and make comparisons on a variety of metrics. I looked at factors such as school size, standardized test results, allocated budget, and school type to help the school board and city mayor determine school budgets and areas of improvement. Throughout this analysis I produced the following key findings:
The top 5 highest performing schools were all charter schools, and the 5 lowest performing schools were all district schools. The 5 lowest performing schools had higher budgets overall and per student than the 5 highest performing schools.
As budget spending ranges per student increased, math, reading, and overall passing rates all decreased. 
Within each individual school, testing scores remained relatively the same from grade to grade. The average testing scores did no vary more than about 2 grade points between any given year from 9th-12th graders.
Small (less than 1000 students) and medium (1000-2000) sized schools had much higher rates of overall passing students (89.9% and 90.6% respectively) than did larger schools (2000-5000 students, 58.3%). 
From this information we can deduce that schools with a large number of students perform worse on standardized testing
